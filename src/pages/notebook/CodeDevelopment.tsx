                <h3>Design Choices for FIRST Tech Challenge Software Architecture</h3>
                <br />
                <p>In designing our robot control system for the FIRST Tech Challenge, we emphasized modularity and maintainability by adopting <strong>dependency injection</strong> as a core architectural principle. The attached UML diagram illustrates our system's high-level structure, showing how the various components, such as controllers, providers, and commanders, interact while adhering to this approach.</p>
                <h4>Key Benefits of Dependency Injection</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Separation of Concerns</strong><br />
                        By decoupling the initialization and management of dependencies from the business logic of each class, we ensured that each component in the system, such as the <code>DrivetrainController</code> or <code>SensorProvider</code>, could focus solely on its specific responsibilities. This separation simplifies testing and debugging while improving overall code clarity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Enhanced Testability</strong><br />
                        Dependency injection allows us to provide mock implementations of interfaces like <code>IDrivetrainController</code> or <code>ISensorProvider</code> during unit testing. This ensures that individual components can be tested in isolation without requiring the full system to be operational.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Scalability and Flexibility</strong><br />
                        As the competition evolves, we may need to integrate new subsystems or modify existing ones. With dependency injection, adding or replacing components is straightforward. For instance, swapping the <code>GamepadCommander</code> with an alternative commander (like a voice control module) would involve minimal changes to the overall structure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Centralized Dependency Management</strong><br />
                        The <code>RobotComponentStore</code> acts as a single registry for all components, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance. This design choice allows us to register and resolve dependencies in one place, reducing the risk of configuration errors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Runtime Configurability</strong><br />
                        Dependency injection provides the flexibility to configure the system dynamically based on the selected mode of operation <code>TeleOpMode</code> or <code>AutoMode</code>. The <code>OpMode</code> enumeration and its integration with the <code>RobotController</code> streamline the initialization of mode-specific dependencies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reduced Code Duplication</strong><br />
                        With interfaces like <code>IComponent</code>, shared behaviors can be abstracted across multiple implementations, such as the <code>ArmController</code> and <code>DrivetrainController</code>. This reduces redundant code and simplifies the implementation of new features.
                    </li>

                <h3>First Drivetrain Test</h3>
                <p className="entry-date">22-01</p>
                <br />
                <p>We were able to assess our drivetrain control once the drivetrain was assembled. It was necessary to invert the horizontal input axis due to a design misinterpretation that caused an incorrect wheel configuration. The robot was able to move in all directions as expected after this correction.</p>
                <p>The robot does not seem to be gaining good traction, leading to slippage during movement. A system to stabilise the robot's heading may be necessary.</p>

                <h3>Stabilisation</h3>
                <p className="entry-date">25-01</p>
                <br />
                <p>The robot's tendency to rotate when moving has been reduced. Since the front motor was driven by a chain with different-sized gears, it was necessary to correct their power ratio. Sadly, the stabilisation system did not improve movement as expected, as the robot now has difficulty moving in the direction of the joystick. This meant that the overall performance is unfortunately worse than before. After investigation, we were unable to identify any problems with the code that could cause this, and when inspecting the operation of the motors we noticed that the front-left spins a little slow. For now, we have disabled the system, and plan to lubricate all moving parts to attempt to resolve this issue.</p>

                <br />
                <p>We cleaned up some redundant code, and implemented the ability to turn without stabilisation. Moving laterally is still sluggish.</p>

                <br />
                <p>The arm can now be controlled with the second gamepad. The controlling motor uses a default encoder to rotate to a target position. Currently, the encoder seems to overshoot the target position. This will likely be fixed by adjusting the PID coefficients of the motor controller.</p>
